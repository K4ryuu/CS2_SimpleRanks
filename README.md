    <h2>CS2 Simple Ranks</h2>
    <p>A CS2 server extension that allows you to create an unlimited number of ranks with customizable experience thresholds and rank colors. Players gain or lose experience during various in-game events, enabling them to advance or regress between ranks. The extension is fully configurable using 'configs.json' and utilizes MySQL to store data. The plugin runs on <a href="href=https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp">CounterStrikeSharp</a>, so you have to install that and put the folder inside build, to your plugins folder for CounterStrikeSharp.</p>
